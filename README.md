This project implements the Front-End for a simple To-Do List web application, using the React JS library, and also Styled Components replacing pure CSS.
It includes the login page and the general UI of the app.
The login authentication logic and the tasks database for each user are not implemented, since this project aims to be a Front-End study only.
